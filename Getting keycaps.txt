Amiga keycaps...

Amigas use keycaps in sizes that did not become the standard. The keys you see in various
photos in this repo and around the web very likely came from either AliExpress (cheap) or 
Pimpmykeyboard.com (expensive, quality).

There are a couple of photos around showing home-made laser printed keys using those blank
AliExpress sets - I dusted the keycap with laser printer toner and then engraved with a 
laser. The laser was never good enough - did not shut off completely during travel so left
hairline marks across the cap, could not position accurately enough, horrible control
software - I gave up.

The sets that look really good are a combination of a key set from pimpmykeyboard.com (a
company run by Signature Plastics) and individual keys ordered with custom legends. 
Before the Akko keycaps became available theirs were about the only 3rd party keycaps I 
liked. Unfortunately they cost a lot. To get started you need one of their sets, the ISO
add-on set, and then a lot of custom keys. I bought the DSA Granite set with ISO extras. 
Then I ordered:

Sorry for the formatting here, it is just copied from the old email receipt.

Finally there was a set of keys they sold that included the left and right Amiga keys,
some Tux keys, other symbols. I can't seem to find it on their web site so maybe they are 
not available now? But these things change. I have also not checked AliExpress recently,
and sellers there just love to rip off logos and stick them on keycaps so you may get
lucky.

Finally, there is a good web page that lets you make custom layouts. Then you can print
them off and use them when planning how you will get each individual key.
